# Online-Teaching-System
An online teaching system written by flask and bootstrap. However, some features have not been realized...

* You should change the database settings in the `config.py`.
* You need to install all dependent libraries of the project according to `requirements.txt`.
* Run `app.py`.
* If you want the courseware preview function to be used normally, please put the project on the public network after running, because I use Microsoft's online preview API interface.
